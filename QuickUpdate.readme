INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
QuickUpdate is a comprehensive library version management utility for AmigaOS 3.x
systems. It provides both a command-line interface and a Workbench GUI for checking
and updating system libraries. The tool helps maintain system stability by ensuring
all libraries are at their recommended versions.

FEATURES
~~~~~~~~
- Checks installed library versions against a maintained database
- Calculates CRC32 checksums to verify file integrity
- Displays detailed version information including origin
- Supports both CLI and Workbench operation
- Maintains a database of known good library versions
- Shows version comparison details before updates
- Handles both version string and datestamp-based versioning

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Copy QuickUpdate to a directory of your choice
2. Copy QuickUpdate.db to PROGDIR: (same directory as the executable)
3. For Workbench usage, ensure the .info file is present
4. Assign PROGDIR: to the installation directory

USAGE
~~~~~
From CLI:
    QuickUpdate LIBRARY=<path> SCAN/S UPDATE/S QUIET/S

    LIBRARY  - Path to specific library to check
    SCAN     - Scan system for outdated libraries
    UPDATE   - Perform updates where needed
    QUIET    - Suppress non-essential output

From Workbench:
    Double-click the icon and use the graphical interface.

DATABASE FORMAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The QuickUpdate.db file contains entries in the following format:
    <checksum>|<filesize>|<filename>|<version>|<revision>|<origin>

You can use CreateDB to maintain and update the database.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Uses standard CRC32-IEEE 802.3 for checksums
- Supports both $VER: string parsing and file datestamp checking
- Implements safe file operations with error handling
- Database entries are validated during loading
- Version comparison considers version, revision, and date

REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~
- AmigaOS 3.0 or higher
- 68020 processor or better recommended
- Sufficient RAM for file operations

DISTRIBUTION
~~~~~~~~~~~
This software may be freely distributed as long as all components remain
unchanged and together.
